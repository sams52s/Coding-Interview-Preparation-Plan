## 📚 Topics Covered:

### [Java Syntax & Structure]() – Learn how Java code is organized and executed.
- [ ] Variables, Data Types, Operators
- [ ] Control Flow (if-else, switch-case, loops)
- [ ] Methods (definition, parameters, return types)
- [ ] Static vs Non-Static Members

### [OOP Concepts]() – Learn how Java models the real world.
- [ ] Classes and Objects
- [ ] Constructors & Overloading
- [ ] Inheritance, Polymorphism
- [ ] Encapsulation
- [ ] Abstraction

### [Collections Framework Introduction]() – Efficiently manage and manipulate groups of data.
- [ ] Core Interfaces (List, Set, Map, Queue)
- [ ] ArrayList, LinkedList basics
- [ ] HashSet, HashMap basics

### [Exception Handling]() – Handle runtime errors gracefully.
- [ ] try-catch-finally block
- [ ] Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
- [ ] Custom Exceptions

### **Big-O Notation** – Analyze the performance of your code.
- [ ] Time and Space Complexity Basics
- [ ] Common Big-O Cases (O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²))

### **DSA Focus: Arrays & Strings**
- [ ] Array Traversal and Updates
- [ ] String Immutability & Basic Manipulations
- [ ] Basic Recursion Concepts (Factorial, Fibonacci)

### 🧪 Practice Focus for this Week

- Solve 2–3 LeetCode/HackerRank/Codeforces/Codechef problems daily.
- Suggested LeetCode Topics: Arrays 101, String problems, Easy recursion.
- Mini Project (Optional): Build a "Student Record Management" mini app (just using classes, arrays).
