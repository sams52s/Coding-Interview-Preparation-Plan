# üìÖ Week 3: Spring Boot + Hibernate + REST APIs

> üéØ This week, transition from Core Java into real-world backend application development. Learn how to build powerful REST APIs with Spring Boot and master ORM using Hibernate.

---

## üìö Topics Covered:

### [Spring Core (IoC & Dependency Injection)]() ‚Äì Understand the heart of Spring Framework.
- [ ] Inversion of Control (IoC) Principle
- [ ] Dependency Injection Types (Constructor, Setter, Field)
- [ ] Bean Lifecycle and Scopes
- [ ] ApplicationContext vs BeanFactory
- [ ] Profiles and Conditional Beans

### [Spring Boot Fundamentals]()) ‚Äì Rapid Java application development made easy.
- [ ] Starters and Auto-Configuration
- [ ] Embedded Servers (Tomcat, Jetty)
- [ ] Externalized Configuration (application.properties, YAML)
- [ ] Profiles & Environment Management

### [Spring MVC (RESTful Services)]() ‚Äì Build Web APIs with Spring MVC.
- [ ] DispatcherServlet Flow
- [ ] Controller-Service-Repository Pattern
- [ ] REST API Design with `@RestController`
- [ ] Exception Handling with `@ControllerAdvice`

### [Hibernate ORM Basics]() ‚Äì Seamlessly connect Java and databases.
- [ ] ORM Concepts
- [ ] Entity Mapping (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany)
- [ ] FetchType (LAZY vs EAGER)
- [ ] CRUD Operations
- [ ] JPQL Basics

### [Spring Data JPA]() ‚Äì Simplify database interaction.
- [ ] JpaRepository and CrudRepository
- [ ] Query Methods (`findByName`, etc.)
- [ ] Custom Queries using `@Query`
- [ ] Transaction Management (@Transactional)

### [Spring Security Basics]() ‚Äì Secure your REST APIs.
- [ ] Basic Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Password Encoding (BCrypt)

### **DSA Focus: Trees, BSTs**
- [ ] Binary Tree Basics
- [ ] Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree Concepts
- [ ] Insert/Search/Delete Operations

---

### üß™ Practice Focus for this Week

- Solve 2‚Äì3 LeetCode/HackerRank/Codeforces/Codechef problems daily focused on Trees/BSTs.
- Build a small Spring Boot REST API Project: (Example ‚Üí "Student Management System" with CRUD operations)
- Secure one endpoint using Basic Authentication (Spring Security).
