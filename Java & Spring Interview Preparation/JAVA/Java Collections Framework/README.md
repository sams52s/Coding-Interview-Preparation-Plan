## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Which collection is fastest?</b></summary>
<p>Depends on context. For key-value lookups, `HashMap` is generally fastest. For insertion-order sets, use `LinkedHashSet`. For sorted keys, prefer `TreeMap`.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How to make collections thread-safe?</b></summary>
<p>Use `Collections.synchronizedList()` for simple wrappers or switch to concurrent versions like `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `ConcurrentHashMap` for better performance in multi-threaded environments.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is ArrayList always better than LinkedList?</b></summary>
<p>No. Use `ArrayList` for random access and `LinkedList` when frequent inserts/removals are expected, especially at ends.</p>
</details>
