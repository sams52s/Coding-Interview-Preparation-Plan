## ü§î Basic Questions

### Q1: What is the Java Collections Framework?
**A:** It is a unified architecture that provides interfaces and classes to store and manipulate groups of data as a single unit.

### Q2: What is the difference between Collection and Collections?
**A:** `Collection` is the root interface in the framework. `Collections` is a utility class that provides static methods for sorting, searching, and manipulating collections.

### Q3: Why doesn't `Map` extend `Collection`?
**A:** Because `Map` deals with key-value pairs rather than individual elements like other collections.

## üî¢ Intermediate Questions

### Q4: Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
| Feature        | ArrayList          | LinkedList           |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Access time    | Fast (O(1))         | Slow (O(n))            |
| Insertion/Del  | Slow (O(n))         | Fast at ends (O(1))    |
| Memory         | Less overhead       | More (due to pointers) |

### Q5: How does HashSet ensure uniqueness?
**A:** It uses `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods internally with a `HashMap` to prevent duplicates.

### Q6: Can we store null in a Collection?
**A:** Yes. Most collections allow null, except TreeMap (key) and TreeSet (elements if not comparable).

### Q7: How is fail-fast behavior achieved in iterators?
**A:** Through a modCount variable in collections which throws `ConcurrentModificationException` when modified outside the iterator.

### Q8: Difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap?
| Feature               | HashMap        | ConcurrentHashMap     |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Thread Safety          | No             | Yes                    |
| Null Key/Value         | One null key   | Null keys not allowed  |
| Performance (concurrent)| Poor           | High (segment locking) |

### Q9: What is the time complexity of HashMap operations?
**A:** Average-case: O(1), Worst-case: O(n) (when many hash collisions occur)

### Q10: What are NavigableMap and NavigableSet?
**A:** Interfaces that extend `SortedMap` and `SortedSet` with navigation methods like `lower()`, `floor()`, `ceiling()`, `higher()`.

### Q11: Explain CopyOnWriteArrayList.
**A:** A thread-safe variant of ArrayList where all mutative operations are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array. Suitable for scenarios with frequent reads and infrequent writes.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Scenario-Based Questions

### Q12: How would you implement an LRU Cache?
**A:** Use `LinkedHashMap` with access order set to `true` and override `removeEldestEntry()`.

### Q13: What is the best data structure to maintain insertion order with fast lookup?
**A:** `LinkedHashMap`

### Q14: How to sort a list of custom objects?
```java
Collections.sort(list, Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge));
```
Or implement `Comparable` in the class.

## üöÄ Collections in Multithreading

### Q15: What are some concurrent collection classes?
- `ConcurrentHashMap`
- `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
- `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`
- `ConcurrentSkipListMap`
- `BlockingQueue` implementations
- `LinkedTransferQueue`
- `ConcurrentLinkedDeque`

### Q16: Difference between synchronizedMap and ConcurrentHashMap?
**A:** `synchronizedMap` locks entire map; `ConcurrentHashMap` allows concurrent reads and updates via segment locking (pre-Java 8) or node-level locking (Java 8+) with higher concurrency.

### Q17: How has ConcurrentHashMap evolved in Java 8+?
**A:** In Java 8+, ConcurrentHashMap replaced segment locking with node-level locking using CAS operations, added stream-friendly methods like `forEach`, `reduce`, and `search`, and supports a configurable concurrency level.

## ü§ñ Code Output Questions

### Q18:
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
list.add(4);
System.out.println(list);
```
**A:** Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` because `Arrays.asList()` returns a fixed-size list.

### Q19:
```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("a", 1);
map.put("b", 2);
map.put("a", 3);
System.out.println(map.size() + ", " + map.get("a"));
```
**A:** Outputs `2, 3` because the duplicate key "a" overwrites the previous value.

### Q20:
```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());
set.add(1);
set.add(3);
set.add(2);
set.forEach(System.out::print);
```
**A:** Outputs `321` because TreeSet maintains sorted order based on the provided comparator.

## üîÑ Java 8+ Collections Features

### Q21: What are the factory methods for collections in Java 9+?
**A:** Java 9 introduced convenient factory methods for creating immutable collections:
```java
List<String> list = List.of("a", "b", "c");
Set<String> set = Set.of("a", "b", "c");
Map<String, Integer> map = Map.of("a", 1, "b", 2);
Map<String, Integer> mapEntries = Map.ofEntries(
    Map.entry("a", 1),
    Map.entry("b", 2)
);
```

### Q22: How do Java Streams interact with Collections?
**A:** Streams provide functional-style operations on collections:
```java
// Finding average age of people over 20
double avgAge = people.stream()
    .filter(p -> p.getAge() > 20)
    .mapToInt(Person::getAge)
    .average()
    .orElse(0);

// Grouping by department
Map<Department, List<Employee>> byDept = employees.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment));
```

### Q23: What is a Spliterator and how does it relate to parallel streams?
**A:** Spliterator is an iterator interface designed for parallel traversal. Collections implement custom spliterators to optimize parallel stream operations by efficiently splitting the data for parallel processing.

## üß© Collection Design Patterns and Advanced Usage

### Q24: How would you implement a thread-safe cache with expiring elements?
**A:** Combining `ConcurrentHashMap` with a background thread or `ScheduledExecutorService`:
```java
public class ExpiringCache<K, V> {
    private final ConcurrentHashMap<K, CacheItem<V>> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
    
    public void put(K key, V value, long expiryTimeMillis) {
        CacheItem<V> item = new CacheItem<>(value, System.currentTimeMillis() + expiryTimeMillis);
        map.put(key, item);
    }
    
    public Optional<V> get(K key) {
        CacheItem<V> item = map.get(key);
        if (item != null && !item.isExpired()) {
            return Optional.of(item.getValue());
        }
        map.remove(key);
        return Optional.empty();
    }
    
    // Start background cleanup
    public void startCleanupTask(long periodMillis) {
        scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
            map.forEach((k, v) -> {
                if (v.isExpired()) map.remove(k);
            });
        }, periodMillis, periodMillis, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }
    
    private static class CacheItem<V> {
        private final V value;
        private final long expiryTime;
        
        // Constructor, getters, isExpired method
    }
}
```

### Q25: How would you implement a bi-directional map?
**A:** Using two HashMaps or using libraries like Apache Commons Collections' BidiMap:
```java
public class BiMap<K, V> {
    private final Map<K, V> forward = new HashMap<>();
    private final Map<V, K> backward = new HashMap<>();
    
    public void put(K key, V value) {
        if (forward.containsKey(key)) {
            backward.remove(forward.get(key));
        }
        if (backward.containsKey(value)) {
            forward.remove(backward.get(value));
        }
        forward.put(key, value);
        backward.put(value, key);
    }
    
    public V getByKey(K key) {
        return forward.get(key);
    }
    
    public K getByValue(V value) {
        return backward.get(value);
    }
    
    // Other methods like remove, size, etc.
}
```

### Q26: What is a weak reference collection and when would you use it?
**A:** Weak reference collections like `WeakHashMap` allow keys to be garbage collected when no strong references to them exist. They're useful for implementing caches that shouldn't prevent objects from being garbage collected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Collection Performance Optimizations

### Q27: How would you tune HashMap/HashSet for better performance?
**A:**
- Set initial capacity to avoid rehashing
- Choose proper load factor
- Ensure good hashCode() implementation
- Use immutable keys for Maps

```java
// Bad
Map<String, Data> map = new HashMap<>(); // Default initial capacity (16)

// Better
Map<String, Data> map = new HashMap<>(1000, 0.75f); // Initial capacity of 1000
```

### Q28: What's the most efficient way to find the intersection of two large collections?
**A:** Convert the smaller collection to a HashSet for O(n) lookup, then iterate through the larger collection checking for membership:

```java
public <T> Set<T> findIntersection(Collection<T> first, Collection<T> second) {
    // Determine which collection is smaller
    Collection<T> smaller = first.size() <= second.size() ? first : second;
    Collection<T> larger = smaller == first ? second : first;
    
    // Create HashSet from smaller collection for O(1) lookups
    Set<T> smallerSet = new HashSet<>(smaller);
    
    // Find intersection by checking membership
    Set<T> intersection = new HashSet<>();
    for (T item : larger) {
        if (smallerSet.contains(item)) {
            intersection.add(item);
        }
    }
    return intersection;
}
```

### Q29: When should you prefer ArrayList vs ArrayDeque?
**A:** 
- Use `ArrayList` for random access operations and when you primarily add/remove elements from the end
- Use `ArrayDeque` for queue/stack operations (adding/removing from both ends) as it offers O(1) operations for add/remove at both ends
