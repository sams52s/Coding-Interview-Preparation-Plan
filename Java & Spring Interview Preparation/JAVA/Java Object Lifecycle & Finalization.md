## 🧩 Object Lifecycle Phases

| Phase                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Instantiation**    | Memory is allocated via `new`, reflection, deserialization, or cloning       |
| **Initialization**   | Fields are initialized via constructors, blocks, or default values           |
| **Usage**            | Object is referenced and participates in logic                               |
| **Unreachability**   | No live reference exists; object becomes eligible for GC                     |
| **Finalization**     | Deprecated hook for pre-GC cleanup (`finalize()` called if overridden)        |
| **Garbage Collection** | JVM reclaims memory and finalizes eligible objects                        |

## 🏗️ Instantiation & Initialization

### ✅ Code Example:
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Initializer block (optional)
    {
        System.out.println("Initialization block executed");
    }
}

Person p = new Person("Alice");
```

### 🔍 Highlights:
- Object is created on the **heap**
- Fields can be initialized via constructors or initializer blocks
- Static blocks initialize static data only once

> 💡 Avoid complex logic in constructors—delegate to factory methods or builder patterns when necessary.

---

## ♻️ Reachability & Garbage Collection (GC)

The JVM uses reachability analysis to identify objects for collection.

### 🔍 Reachability Levels:
- **Strong**: default references
- **Soft**: eligible for GC when memory is low (`SoftReference`)
- **Weak**: collected eagerly (`WeakReference`)
- **Phantom**: accessed only via reference queues, used with `Cleaner`

### Code Example:
```java
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
obj = null; // eligible for GC
```

> ⚠️ Circular references do **not** prevent GC unless strong references exist.

---

## ⚰️ Finalization (Deprecated)

The `finalize()` method is **deprecated** as of Java 9 and removed in Java 18.

### 🔥 Example (Not Recommended):
```java
@Override
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    System.out.println("Cleaning up");
}
```

### 🚫 Drawbacks:
- Non-deterministic behavior
- Possible memory leaks and performance overhead
- Risk of object **resurrection**

> ✅ Use `try-with-resources`, `AutoCloseable`, or `Cleaner` instead.

---

## 🧼 Cleaner API (Java 9+)

### ✅ Modern Finalization:
```java
Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();
class State implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Resource cleaned");
    }
}

Object resource = new Object();
cleaner.register(resource, new State());
```

### 🔍 Benefits:
- Thread-safe and predictable cleanup
- No subclassing required

> 📘 Use `Cleaner` for custom cleanup logic in long-lived applications or non-closeable resources.

---

## 🔐 Try-With-Resources (For AutoCloseable)

### Example:
```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
}
```

### 🔍 Benefits:
- Automatic resource release
- No need for `finally` block
- Ensures exception-safe cleanup

---

## 🧰 Best Practices for Lifecycle Management

- Use `AutoCloseable` for resources (files, DB connections)
- Prefer factory methods or builders over complex constructors
- Avoid static references for large or long-lived objects
- Use weak references for caches and listeners
- Monitor memory with **JVisualVM**, **JFR**, or **Eclipse MAT**
- Profile GC with `-XX:+PrintGCDetails` and tuning flags

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

- ❓ **What is the full lifecycle of a Java object?**
  > Instantiation → Initialization → Usage → Unreachability → GC → (optionally) Finalization

- ❓ **What happens when an object becomes unreachable?**
  > It becomes eligible for GC and will be cleaned up in a future GC cycle.

- ❓ **Is `finalize()` called for every object?**
  > No. Only if overridden, and even then it's not guaranteed. It is deprecated.

- ❓ **How does the JVM decide when to run garbage collection?**
  > The JVM triggers garbage collection based on several factors:
  > - When heap memory reaches allocation threshold (typically 70-80% full)
  > - During memory pressure situations
  > - Explicitly via `System.gc()` (though only as a hint)
  > - Based on GC algorithm-specific heuristics (generational collection patterns)
  > - After a certain number of allocations in young generation spaces
  > Different GC algorithms (Serial, Parallel, CMS, G1, ZGC, Shenandoah) have different triggering mechanisms.

- ❓ **What is object resurrection and how to avoid it?**
  > Object resurrection occurs when an object scheduled for GC is "revived" by storing a reference to `this` in a static field or other live object during `finalize()`. This can cause memory leaks as the object escapes garbage collection.

  > Example:
  > ```java
  > public class Zombie {
  >     static Zombie zombie;
  >     
  >     @Override
  >     protected void finalize() {
  >         zombie = this; // Resurrection!
  >     }
  > }
  > ```
  > Avoid by:
  > - Never overriding `finalize()`
  > - Using `Cleaner` or `try-with-resources` instead
  > - Following proper resource management patterns

- ❓ **How can we ensure predictable cleanup of resources?**
  > For deterministic resource cleanup:
  > 1. **try-with-resources** for `AutoCloseable` resources
  >    ```java
  >    try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
  >        // Use resource
  >    } // Automatically closed
  >    ```
  > 2. **Cleaner API** for non-AutoCloseable resources
  >    ```java
  >    public class CleanableResource implements AutoCloseable {
  >        private static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();
  >        private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;
  >        private final State state;
  >        
  >        public CleanableResource() {
  >            state = new State();
  >            cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);
  >        }
  >        
  >        @Override
  >        public void close() {
  >            cleanable.clean();
  >        }
  >        
  >        static class State implements Runnable {
  >            @Override
  >            public void run() {
  >                // Resource cleanup logic
  >            }
  >        }
  >    }
  >    ```
  > 3. **PhantomReference** with ReferenceQueue for advanced cleanup scenarios
  > 4. **Explicit close methods** with clear documentation

- ❓ **What are phantom references used for?**
  > Phantom references provide:
  > - Post-finalization cleanup (after object is collected but before memory is reclaimed)
  > - Resource cleanup without resurrection risk (unlike `finalize()`)
  > - Direct memory or off-heap resource management
  > - Monitoring object lifecycle in sophisticated memory management scenarios
  > 
  > Example:
  > ```java
  > ReferenceQueue<Object> refQueue = new ReferenceQueue<>();
  > Object obj = new Object();
  > PhantomReference<Object> phantom = new PhantomReference<>(obj, refQueue);
  > obj = null; // Original reference cleared
  > 
  > // Clean-up thread
  > Reference<?> ref;
  > while ((ref = refQueue.poll()) != null) {
  >     // Cleanup associated resources
  >     // The referent object itself is not accessible
  > }
  > ```

- ❓ **What tools help track object lifecycle and memory leaks?**
  > **Runtime Monitoring Tools:**
  > - Java Flight Recorder (JFR) - built-in low-overhead profiling
  > - JVisualVM - visual profiling and monitoring
  > - VisualVM with Visual GC plugin - visualization of GC activity
  > - Java Mission Control (JMC) - comprehensive monitoring
  > 
  > **Memory Analysis Tools:**
  > - Eclipse Memory Analyzer (MAT) - heap dump analysis with leak detection
  > - YourKit Java Profiler - memory/CPU profiling with leak detection
  > - JProfiler - detailed object allocation and reference tracking
  > - Heap dumps (via jmap, jcmd) - snapshot analysis
  > 
  > **GC Analysis:**
  > - GC logs with `-Xlog:gc*` (Java 9+) or `-XX:+PrintGCDetails` (pre-Java 9)
  > - GCViewer or GCEasy for log visualization
  > - Async-profiler for allocation profiling

- ❓ **Can memory leaks still occur in Java?**
  > Yes. Common memory leak patterns include:
  > - **Static Collections:** Objects added to static collections and never removed
  > - **Unclosed Resources:** Streams, connections, or file handles not properly closed
  > - **Listener Registration:** Adding listeners but never removing them
  > - **ThreadLocal Variables:** Not properly cleared in long-lived threads
  > - **Classloader Leaks:** Preventing classloaders from being garbage collected
  > - **Custom Caches:** Without proper eviction policies
  > - **Inner Class References:** Anonymous inner classes holding implicit references to outer instances
  > 
  > Detection techniques:
  > - Heap histogram analysis
  > - Dominator tree analysis in MAT
  > - LeakCanary-like leak detection frameworks
  > - Regular heap dump comparisons

- ❓ **What's the difference between various GC algorithms in Java?**
  > - **Serial GC** (`-XX:+UseSerialGC`): Single-threaded, simple, suitable for small applications
  > - **Parallel GC** (`-XX:+UseParallelGC`): Multi-threaded young and old generation collection
  > - **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS)** (deprecated): Low pause times but higher CPU usage
  > - **G1 GC** (`-XX:+UseG1GC`): Default since Java 9, region-based, balanced throughput/latency
  > - **ZGC** (`-XX:+UseZGC`): Low latency (<10ms pauses), scalable to terabytes of heap
  > - **Shenandoah GC** (`-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`): Low pause times, concurrent compaction
  >
  > Selection criteria depends on application requirements for latency vs throughput vs memory overhead.

- ❓ **How do different reference types affect object lifecycle?**
  > Reference types form a reachability hierarchy:
  > - **Strong References:** `Object obj = new Object();` - Normal references, prevent GC
  > - **Soft References:** `SoftReference<Object> soft = new SoftReference<>(obj);` - Cleared before OOM, ideal for caches
  > - **Weak References:** `WeakReference<Object> weak = new WeakReference<>(obj);` - Cleared in next GC cycle after object becomes weakly reachable
  > - **Phantom References:** `PhantomReference<Object> phantom = new PhantomReference<>(obj, refQueue);` - Used with ReferenceQueue, never return referent
  >
  > Use cases:
  > - Soft: Memory-sensitive caches
  > - Weak: Canonicalizing mappings (WeakHashMap), observer patterns
  > - Phantom: Pre-mortem cleanup without resurrection risk

- ❓ **What are memory barriers and how do they relate to object lifecycle?**
  > Memory barriers are CPU instructions ensuring visibility of memory operations across threads:
  > - **Store barrier:** Ensures writes before barrier are visible to other threads
  > - **Load barrier:** Ensures reads after barrier see most recent writes from other threads
  > - **Full barrier:** Both store and load barriers
  >
  > In Java object lifecycle:
  > - Ensures proper visibility of object initialization across threads
  > - `volatile` fields create memory barriers
  > - `synchronized` blocks establish full barriers on entry/exit
  > - Important for safe publication of objects and preventing partially constructed object visibility

- ❓ **What is escape analysis and how does it affect object allocation?**
  > Escape analysis is a JIT compiler optimization that:
  > - Determines if objects "escape" their creating method or thread
  > - For non-escaping objects, enables:
  >   - **Stack allocation** instead of heap allocation
  >   - **Scalar replacement** (replacing objects with their fields)
  >   - **Lock elision** (removing unnecessary synchronization)
  >
  > This can eliminate GC overhead for short-lived objects and improve performance.
  > Enable with `-XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis` (default: on)
