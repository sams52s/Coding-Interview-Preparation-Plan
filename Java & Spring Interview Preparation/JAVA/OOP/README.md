## üîç Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. Java is fundamentally an object-oriented language built around the concept of objects that contain both data and methods. This section covers core OOP principles, advanced techniques, and design patterns in Java to help you master object-oriented design for interviews and real-world applications.

---

## üìÇ Contents

- **Classes and Objects**: Fundamentals of class design, object creation, constructors
- **Encapsulation**: Access modifiers, getters/setters, proper data hiding
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes, method overriding, `super` keyword
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading, runtime polymorphism, interfaces vs abstract classes
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes, interfaces, default methods
- **Composition vs Inheritance**: When to use each approach
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **Design Patterns**: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns in Java

> Each file includes diagrams, use cases, code samples, trade-offs, and interview-ready notes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Begin with the "Classes and Objects" topic to understand the foundation
2. Practice implementing small examples for each concept
3. Follow the learning path in order for optimal understanding
4. Complete the exercises at the end of each topic
5. Review the interview questions to test your knowledge

---

## üéØ Goals

After completing this section, you should be able to:

- Implement Java classes with proper encapsulation
- Design inheritance hierarchies that follow best practices
- Apply polymorphism to create flexible and extensible code
- Differentiate between abstraction mechanisms in Java
- Make informed decisions between composition and inheritance
- Apply SOLID principles to your code
- Recognize and implement common design patterns
- Answer interview questions about OOP concepts with confidence

---

## üõ† How to Use

1. Read the concept explanation first
2. Study the provided diagrams to understand relationships
3. Analyze the code examples and run them locally
4. Complete the exercises without looking at solutions
5. Review interview questions and practice answering them
6. Implement the mini-projects to solidify understanding
7. Use the cheat sheets for quick reference during interviews

---

## üî• Highlights

- **Real-World Examples**: Each concept is illustrated with practical, industry-relevant examples
- **Visual Learning**: UML diagrams for complex relationships
- **Common Pitfalls**: Sections highlighting frequent mistakes and how to avoid them
- **Interview Spotlight**: Specifically tagged sections covering common interview questions
- **Performance Considerations**: Notes on efficiency and optimization for each pattern
- **Java-Specific Features**: Focus on Java's implementation of OOP concepts

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What's the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?**
   - An abstract class can have state and implemented methods, while interfaces traditionally define only abstract methods (though Java 8+ allows default implementations). A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class.

2. **How does polymorphism work in Java?**
   - Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It's achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

3. **When should I use composition over inheritance?**
   - Use composition when you want to reuse functionality without exposing the entire interface of the composed class. "Favor composition over inheritance" is a design principle that promotes more flexible and maintainable code.

4. **How do I implement the Singleton pattern in Java?**
   - Implement with a private constructor, a private static instance, and a public static method to access the instance. Consider thread safety with double-checked locking or using an enum.

5. **What are SOLID principles and why are they important?**
   - SOLID principles are five design principles that make software more maintainable and extensible. They help create cleaner, more modular code that's easier to test and adapt to changing requirements.
