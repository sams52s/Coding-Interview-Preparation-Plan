- ✅ Foreign Function & Memory API (2nd Preview)



### Java 20 (March 2023)

- ✅ Virtual Threads (2nd Preview - JEP 436)
- ✅ Record Patterns (Preview - JEP 432)
- ✅ Foreign Function & Memory API (3rd Preview)



### Java 21 (September 2023) – LTS

- ✅ Virtual Threads (Standard - JEP 444)
- ✅ Record Patterns (Standard - JEP 440)
- ✅ Pattern Matching for Switch (Standard - JEP 441)
- ✅ Scoped Values (Preview - JEP 445)
- ✅ Sequenced Collections (JEP 431)



### Java 22 (March 2024)

- ✅ **Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview - JEP 443)**
  ```java
  // Before Java 22
  List<Point> points = List.of(new Point(1, 2), new Point(3, 4));
  for (Point point : points) {
      System.out.println(point.x() + ", " + point.y());
  }

  // With Java 22
  // Unnamed variables and patterns allow you to focus on the relevant parts of a record or object during iteration.
  // Here, we only care about the 'x' coordinate of the Point record.
  for (Point(var x, _) : points) {  // '_' indicates unused y coordinate
      System.out.println("x: " + x);
  }
  ```
  **Explanation**: This feature enhances code readability by allowing developers to omit variable names that are not used within a loop or pattern matching context. The underscore `_` is used to denote an unnamed variable, signaling that the variable is intentionally ignored. This is particularly useful when dealing with records or objects with multiple fields, but only a subset of them are relevant in a specific context. It reduces visual clutter and makes the code's intent clearer.

- ✅ **Stream Gatherers (Incubator - JEP 461)**
  ```java
  // Complex stream operations made easier
  record Transaction(String type, double amount) {}
  
  var transactions = List.of(
      new Transaction("DEPOSIT", 100.0),
      new Transaction("WITHDRAWAL", 50.0)
  );

  // Using Stream Gatherers for complex aggregation
  // Stream Gatherers provide a more flexible way to perform complex stream operations.
  // In this example, we use a gatherer to compute the sum and count of transaction amounts.
  var summary = transactions.stream().gather(Gatherers
      .fold(
          () -> new double[2],  // [sum, count] - Initial accumulator
          (acc, t) -> {         // Accumulator function
              acc[0] += t.amount(); // Sum the amount
              acc[1]++;            // Increment the count
          },
          (acc1, acc2) -> new double[] {  // Combiner function (for parallel streams)
              acc1[0] + acc2[0],
              acc1[1] + acc2[1]
          }
      )
  );
  ```
  **Explanation**: Stream Gatherers introduce a new, more flexible way to perform custom intermediate stream operations, filling the gaps left by existing operations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. The `Gatherers.fold` method is used here to accumulate the sum and count of transaction amounts. The accumulator function updates the sum and count for each transaction, and the combiner function merges the results from different parallel streams, ensuring correct results in parallel processing scenarios. This is particularly useful for complex aggregations or transformations that are difficult to express with standard stream operations.

- ✅ **Foreign Function & Memory API (4th Preview - JEP 447)**
  ```java
  // Native method call without JNI
  import java.lang.foreign.*;
  import static java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.*;

  public class NativeExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          try (Arena arena = Arena.openConfined()) {
              // Lookup the 'strlen' function from the standard C library
              SymbolLookup stdlib = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup("libc.so.6", arena);
              MethodHandle strlen = stdlib.find("strlen")
                  .map(symbol -> Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
                      symbol,
                      FunctionDescriptor.of(JAVA_LONG, ADDRESS)))
                  .orElseThrow();

              // Allocate a memory segment for the string "Hello"
              MemorySegment str = arena.allocateUtf8String("Hello");
              // Invoke the 'strlen' function to get the length of the string
              long len = (long) strlen.invoke(str);
              System.out.println("Length: " + len);
          } catch (Throwable e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  **Explanation**: The Foreign Function & Memory API (FFM API) allows Java programs to interact with native code and memory regions without the need for JNI, which is often cumbersome and error-prone. This example demonstrates how to call the `strlen` function from the standard C library to determine the length of a string. The `Arena` is used for automatic memory management, ensuring that native memory is properly deallocated when no longer needed. `SymbolLookup` is used to find the native function, and `MethodHandle` provides a way to invoke the function. This API is crucial for high-performance applications that require access to native resources or libraries.

### Java 23 (Expected September 2024)

- ✅ **Enhanced Record Patterns**
  ```java
  record Person(String name, Address address) {}
  record Address(String street, String city) {}

  // Pattern matching with records
  void printPersonDetails(Person person) {
      // Enhanced pattern matching allows you to directly extract nested record components.
      if (person instanceof Person(String name, Address(String street, var city))) {
          System.out.println("Found person: " + name + " living in " + city);
      }
  }
  ```
  **Explanation**: Enhanced record patterns simplify the process of extracting data from nested records, making the code more concise and readable. The `instanceof` operator is used to check if a `Person` object matches the specified pattern, and the nested `Address` record is deconstructed to extract the street and city directly within the `if` condition. This reduces the need for explicit getter calls and makes the code's intent clearer.

- ✅ **Sealed Interface Improvements**
  ```java
  sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle {
      double area();
      
      // New: Sealed interface with default implementations
      // Sealed interfaces can now have default implementations, providing a common behavior for all implementing classes.
      default String getType() {
          return switch (this) {
              case Circle c -> "Circle";
              case Rectangle r -> "Rectangle";
              case Triangle t -> "Triangle";
          };
      }
  }
  ```
  **Explanation**: Sealed interfaces restrict which classes can implement them, providing more control over the inheritance hierarchy and enabling more precise reasoning about the possible implementations. The addition of default implementations allows sealed interfaces to provide common behavior for all implementing classes, reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse. This is particularly useful for defining common methods or properties that all implementations should share.

### Java 24 (Expected March 2025)

- ✅ **Structured Concurrency (Final)**
  ```java
  try (var scope = StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
      // Fork two tasks to fetch user data and orders concurrently.
      Future<String> user = scope.fork(() -> fetchUser(userId));
      Future<List<Order>> orders = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrders(userId));
      
      scope.join();           // Wait for all tasks to complete
      scope.throwIfFailed();  // ... and propagate errors
      
      // Process results
      return new UserData(user.resultNow(), orders.resultNow());
  }
  ```
  **Explanation**: Structured concurrency simplifies concurrent programming by treating a group of related tasks as a single unit, making it easier to manage and reason about concurrent code. The `StructuredTaskScope` ensures that all tasks are completed before proceeding, and any errors are automatically propagated to the main thread, preventing common concurrency issues such as orphaned threads or unhandled exceptions. The `ShutdownOnFailure` strategy ensures that if any task fails, all other tasks are cancelled, preventing further execution and ensuring a consistent state.

- ✅ **Vector API (Production)**
  ```java
  void vectorComputation() {
      // Perform vector computation using the Vector API.
      // This example multiplies two vectors and adds the result to the first vector.
      var vector1 = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES_256, data1, 0);
      var vector2 = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES_256, data2, 0);
      var result = vector1.mul(vector2).add(vector1);
      result.intoArray(output, 0);
  }
  ```
  **Explanation**: The Vector API enables high-performance SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations on arrays of primitive types, allowing developers to leverage the underlying hardware capabilities for parallel processing. This example demonstrates how to perform a vector multiplication and addition using the `FloatVector` class, which operates on 256-bit vectors of floats. This can significantly improve the performance of numerical computations, image processing, and other data-intensive tasks.

## 🗺 Advanced Project Details

### 🚀 Project Loom
- **Goal:** Simplify concurrency with virtual threads and structured concurrency.
- **Impact:** Massive scalability improvements for I/O-bound services.

```java
// Virtual Thread Example
public class VirtualThreadServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080);
        while (true) {
            Socket socket = server.accept();
            // Start a new virtual thread for each incoming connection.
            Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> handleConnection(socket));
        }
    }

    private static void handleConnection(Socket socket) {
        // Handle connection without blocking OS thread
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: Project Loom introduces virtual threads, which are lightweight threads managed by the JVM, that can significantly improve the scalability of I/O-bound applications. Unlike traditional OS threads, virtual threads are inexpensive to create and manage, allowing developers to create millions of them without significant performance overhead. This example shows how to start a new virtual thread for each incoming connection in a server application, enabling the server to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

### 🧬 Project Valhalla
- **Goal:** Better interop with native libraries (C, C++, etc.)
- **Impact:** High-performance bindings without JNI complexity.

```java
// Future Value Types Example
value class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;
    
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    
    public int x() { return x; }
    public int y() { return y; }
}
```
**Explanation**: Project Valhalla aims to introduce value types, which are immutable data types that can be stored inline in memory, reducing memory overhead and improving performance. Value types do not have object identity and are treated as primitive types by the JVM, allowing for more efficient memory layout and reduced garbage collection overhead. This example shows a simple value class `Point` with two integer fields, demonstrating how value types can be used to represent simple data structures more efficiently.

### 🌐 Project Panama
- **Goal:** Better interop with native libraries (C, C++, etc.)
- **Impact:** High-performance bindings without JNI complexity.

### 🧰 Project Amber
- **Goal:** Smaller Java enhancements like pattern matching, switch expressions, and records.
- **Impact:** Better developer ergonomics.

### 🔬 Project Leyden
- **Goal:** Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for faster startup and smaller footprint.
- **Impact:** Cloud-native Java optimization.
