# 📅 Week 2: Advanced Java + Intermediate DSA

> 🎯 This week, strengthen your Java knowledge with powerful concepts like Generics, I/O, and Lambda expressions. Improve your DSA skills by mastering Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and core Sorting techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered:

### [Generics]() – Create reusable, type-safe Java classes and methods.
- [ ] Type Parameters (`<T>`, `<E>`, etc.)
- [ ] Wildcards (`<?>`, `<? extends T>`, `<? super T>`)
- [ ] Bounded Types
- [ ] Generic Methods and Classes

### [Java I/O and NIO]() – Efficiently handle files and streams.
- [ ] InputStream, OutputStream, Readers, Writers
- [ ] File handling (FileReader, BufferedReader)
- [ ] Java NIO (Buffers, Channels, Selectors)
- [ ] Serialization and Deserialization

### [Lambda & Streams (Java 8+)]() – Embrace functional programming.
- [ ] Lambda Expressions Syntax
- [ ] Stream API Basics (filter, map, reduce)
- [ ] Method References
- [ ] Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Function, Supplier, Consumer)
- [ ] Optional Class

### [Java Annotations]() – Understand metadata-driven Java programming.
- [ ] Built-in Annotations (@Override, @SuppressWarnings)
- [ ] Custom Annotations
- [ ] Retention, Target, Reflection Processing

### [Java Memory Management]() – Manage Java application performance.
- [ ] JVM Memory Structure (Heap, Stack, Method Area)
- [ ] Garbage Collection Overview (G1, ZGC, Shenandoah)
- [ ] Memory Leak Prevention
- [ ] JVM Flags and Profiling

### **DSA Focus: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Sorting**
- [ ] Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List Basics
- [ ] Stack and Queue Implementations
- [ ] Priority Queues Overview
- [ ] Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort and Quick Sort Basics
- [ ] Binary Search Algorithm

### 🧪 Practice Focus for this Week

- Solve 2–3 LeetCode/HackerRank/Codeforces/Codechef problems daily.
- Focus strongly on Linked List & Stack problems (common interview favorites!).
- Mini Project (Optional): Build a simple "Library Management System" (use Generics + Collections).
