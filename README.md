> Understand core Object-Oriented Programming principles with real-world examples.

- Collections Framework Basics

> Introduction to List, Set, Map interfaces and their key implementations.

- Exception Handling

> Handle errors gracefully using try-catch-finally, custom exceptions, and best practices.

- Generics Basics

> Understand type safety, wildcards, and generic classes/interfaces.

- JVM Memory Model and Garbage Collection

> Explore heap, stack, garbage collection processes and how Java manages memory.

- DSA: Arrays and Strings

> Solve problems on array manipulation, string operations, and basic recursion.

> Understand threads, synchronization, race conditions, and concurrent collections.

- Java 8 Features (Lambda, Streams, Functional Interfaces)

> Learn functional programming concepts introduced in Java 8.

- Serialization, Reflection API, Annotations

> Explore how Java handles object persistence and metadata processing.

- Advanced Collections Concepts

> Learn about fail-fast iterators, hashing mechanisms, and deep dive into HashMap internals.

- Java 9-17 Features Overview

> Review modern Java updates like modules, records, sealed classes, and text blocks.

- DSA: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

> Solve problems involving pointers, stack/queue behavior, and priority queues.

## [🗓️ Week 3: Spring Boot + Hibernate + REST APIs](week_3/README.md)

- Spring Core Concepts (IoC, DI, Bean Lifecycle)

> Master dependency injection and the core idea behind Spring's flexibility.

- Spring Boot Basics

> Rapidly develop Java applications with auto-configuration and minimal setup.

- Spring MVC

> Build RESTful services using controller-service-repository structure.

- Hibernate ORM Basics

> Learn object-relational mapping, entity relationships, and CRUD operations.

- Spring Security Introduction

> Implement basic authentication, authorization, and secure your APIs.

- DSA: Trees and Basic Graphs

> Solve problems related to tree traversals, BSTs, and graph traversals.

---

## [🗓️ Week 4: System Design + API Advanced + Behavioral Prep](week_4/README.md)

- System Design Basics

> Learn scalability principles, caching, sharding, replication, and high availability.

- Event-Driven Architecture

> Understand message queues, pub-sub models, and distributed systems basics.

- Advanced API Design Patterns

> Explore API pagination, filtering, bulk operations, error handling strategies.

- Advanced SQL Concepts

> Practice complex joins, indexes, transaction isolation levels, and query optimizations.

- Behavioral Interview Preparation (STAR Method)

> Prepare structured answers for project explanations, conflict resolution, leadership.

- DSA: Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Graphs

> Tackle more complex coding problems using optimal techniques.

---

## [🗓️ Week 5: Full Revision + Mock Interviews](week_5/README.md)

- Java Core + DSA Full Revision

> Recap syntax, OOP, collections, concurrency, and solve mixed problems.
