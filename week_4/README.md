## 6. DevSecOps Practices and Tools

### Overview
DevSecOps integrates security into every phase of the DevOps lifecycle, ensuring continuous security and compliance without slowing down development.

### Key Practices
- Shift-left security: Integrate security early in the development process.
- Automated security testing: Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
- Secrets management: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
- Container security: Scan images with Clair or Trivy.
- Infrastructure security: Implement policy as code with tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA).

### Tools
- **Snyk**: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies.
- **Aqua Security**: Container security platform.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis.
- **Twistlock (Palo Alto Prisma Cloud)**: Cloud-native security platform.

### Real-World Use Case
A fintech company integrated SAST and DAST tools into their CI/CD pipeline, catching vulnerabilities before deployment, reducing production incidents by 40%.

### Example: Integrating Snyk in GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  snyk:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Snyk to check vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: test
```

---

## 7. Frontend Integration (React, Angular, Vue)

### Overview
Modern system design requires smooth integration between backend services and frontend frameworks.

### React
- Component-based architecture.
- Use of hooks for state and lifecycle management.
- Integration with REST/gRPC APIs via Axios or Fetch.

**Example: Fetching data in React**

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setUsers(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (<li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default UserList;
```

### Angular
- Uses TypeScript and RxJS for reactive programming.
- Built-in dependency injection.
- HTTPClient for API calls.

**Example: Angular service to fetch data**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class UserService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getUsers(): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.get('/api/users');
  }
}
```

### Vue
- Lightweight and flexible.
- Vuex for state management.
- Axios for HTTP requests.

**Example: Vue component fetching data**

```vue
<template>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">{{ user.name }}</li>
  </ul>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
  data() {
    return { users: [] };
  },
  mounted() {
    axios.get('/api/users').then(response => {
      this.users = response.data;
    });
  }
};
</script>
```

### Real-World Use Case
An e-commerce platform used React with GraphQL to optimize frontend-backend communication, reducing data over-fetching and improving load times.

## 8. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi)

### Overview
IaC enables automated, repeatable infrastructure provisioning and management.

### Terraform
- Declarative language (HCL).
- Provider ecosystem (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes).
- State management for tracking infrastructure.

**Example: Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

### Pulumi
- Uses general-purpose languages (TypeScript, Python, Go).
- Allows complex logic and reusable components.

**Example: Pulumi TypeScript to create an S3 bucket**

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket", {
    acl: "private",
});
```

### Real-World Use Case
A SaaS startup adopted Terraform for multi-cloud deployments, enabling consistent environment setup and reducing manual errors.

## 9. Machine Learning Integration

### Overview
Integrating ML models into system architecture enables intelligent features like recommendations, fraud detection, and personalization.

### Common Approaches
- Model as a Service: Deploy models via REST/gRPC APIs.
- Batch inference pipelines for offline predictions.
- Online inference for real-time predictions.

### Tools & Frameworks
- TensorFlow Serving
- MLflow for model tracking
- Kubeflow for ML pipelines
- AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, GCP AI Platform

### Example: Simple Flask API serving a scikit-learn model

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json['data']
    prediction = model.predict([data])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Real-World Use Case
Netflix uses ML to personalize content recommendations, increasing user engagement and retention.

## 10. Cloud-Native Practices (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Overview
Cloud-native architectures leverage managed services, container orchestration, and microservices for scalability and agility.

### AWS
- Services: EC2, Lambda, ECS/EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch.
- Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation or CDK.
- Serverless computing with Lambda.

### Azure
- Services: Azure Functions, AKS, Cosmos DB, Azure Monitor.
- Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.
- Integration with Active Directory for identity management.

### GCP
- Services: Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, GKE, BigQuery.
- Deployment Manager for IaC.
- Stackdriver for monitoring and logging.

### Real-World Use Case
A global media company migrated to Kubernetes on AWS EKS, enabling zero-downtime deployments and autoscaling during peak traffic.

---

## 11. Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

### Overview
Observability ensures visibility into system health, performance, and debugging capabilities.

### Prometheus
- Metrics collection and alerting.
- Pull-based model with exporters.
- Query language: PromQL.

### Grafana
- Visualization of metrics.
- Dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Supports multiple data sources including Prometheus, Elasticsearch.

### ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Centralized logging solution.
- Logstash for log ingestion and transformation.
- Elasticsearch for storage and search.
- Kibana for visualization.

### Example: Prometheus metrics exposition in a Python app

```python
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary
import random
import time

REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')

@REQUEST_TIME.time()
def process_request():
    time.sleep(random.random())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    start_http_server(8000)
    while True:
        process_request()
```

### Real-World Use Case
Uber uses Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring microservices performance and ELK for centralized logging, enabling rapid incident response.
