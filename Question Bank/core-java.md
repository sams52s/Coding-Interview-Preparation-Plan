## â˜• Core Java Concepts â€” Interview Q&A

---

### HashMap internal working & collision handling

**Interviewer:** How does a HashMap work internally?  
**Candidate:** It uses an array of buckets, where each key's hashCode determines the bucket index. If multiple keys map to the same bucket (collision), they are stored as a linked list or tree (Java 8+).

---

### equals() and hashCode()

**Interviewer:** Why are equals() and hashCode() important?  
**Candidate:** equals() defines logical equality; hashCode() ensures that equal objects return the same hash value. They're crucial for using objects as keys in hash-based collections.

---

### Wrapper classes

**Interviewer:** What are wrapper classes in Java?  
**Candidate:** They are object representations of primitive types, like Integer for int. They allow primitives to be used in collections and support features like nullability and generics.

---

### String pool

**Interviewer:** What is the Java String pool?  
**Candidate:** It's a special memory region where Java stores unique string literals to save memory and improve performance through string interning.

---

### Generics (methods, classes)

**Interviewer:** Why do we use generics?  
**Candidate:** Generics provide type safety and reduce the need for type casting, improving code readability and maintainability.

---

### ClassLoader types

**Interviewer:** What are the types of ClassLoaders?  
**Candidate:** Bootstrap, Extension, and Application ClassLoaders â€” they load core classes, JDK extensions, and application-level classes, respectively.

---

### Marker interfaces

**Interviewer:** What is a marker interface?  
**Candidate:** It's an interface with no methods, used to signal metadata to the JVM or frameworks, like Serializable or Cloneable.

---

### Serialization & deserialization

**Interviewer:** How does serialization work in Java?  
**Candidate:** It converts an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission; deserialization reconstructs the object. This requires the class to implement Serializable.

---

### Optional class

**Interviewer:** What is the purpose of Optional?  
**Candidate:** It represents a value that might be present or absent, helping to avoid NullPointerExceptions and improving API design.

---

### Java 8 Stream API

**Interviewer:** What does the Stream API offer?  
**Candidate:** It enables functional-style operations on collections, such as map, filter, reduce, and supports parallel execution.

---

### Parallel streams vs streams

**Interviewer:** What's the difference between parallel streams and regular streams?  
**Candidate:** Parallel streams split tasks across multiple threads to improve performance on multicore systems, but they add overhead and require thread-safety.

---

## ðŸ“š Collections Framework â€” Interview Q&A

---

### List, Set, Map differences

**Interviewer:** How do List, Set, and Map differ?  
**Candidate:** List is ordered and allows duplicates; Set is unordered and unique; Map stores key-value pairs.

---

### ArrayList vs LinkedList vs Vector

**Interviewer:** When would you use each?  
**Candidate:** ArrayList offers fast random access, LinkedList excels at frequent insertions/removals, Vector is synchronized for thread-safe operations.

---

### HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet

**Interviewer:** How do the Set types compare?  
**Candidate:** HashSet is unordered, TreeSet is sorted, LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order.

---

### HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap vs Hashtable

**Interviewer:** What's the difference?  
**Candidate:** HashMap is non-thread-safe, ConcurrentHashMap supports concurrent access, Hashtable is legacy and fully synchronized.

---

### PriorityQueue, Deque

**Interviewer:** What's the use of PriorityQueue?  
**Candidate:** It allows efficient retrieval of the smallest/largest element based on a comparator or natural ordering.

**Interviewer:** What about Deque?  
**Candidate:** Deque supports insertion and removal from both ends, functioning as both a stack and queue.

---

### Iterator vs ListIterator

**Interviewer:** What's the difference?  
**Candidate:** Iterator allows forward-only traversal; ListIterator allows bidirectional traversal and element modification.

---

### Double brace initialization

**Interviewer:** What is double brace initialization?  
**Candidate:** It's a concise way to initialize collections but creates anonymous inner classes, which may lead to memory leaks.

---

### Collections sorting & Comparable interface

**Interviewer:** How do you sort collections?  
**Candidate:** Using Collections.sort() or stream().sorted(), relying on Comparable for natural order or Comparator for custom order.

---

## ðŸ›¡ Exception Handling â€” Interview Q&A

---

### Checked vs unchecked exceptions

**Interviewer:** What's the difference?  
**Candidate:** Checked exceptions are verified at compile-time; unchecked (RuntimeException) are not, representing programming errors.

---

### try-catch-finally

**Interviewer:** How does try-catch-finally work?  
**Candidate:** try wraps code that may throw exceptions; catch handles them; finally executes code regardless of exceptions, typically cleanup.

---

### throw vs throws

**Interviewer:** How do throw and throws differ?  
**Candidate:** throw is used to explicitly throw an exception; throws declares exceptions a method might propagate.

---

### Custom exceptions

**Interviewer:** How do you create a custom exception?  
**Candidate:** Extend Exception (for checked) or RuntimeException (for unchecked), optionally adding custom fields or methods.

---

### Exception propagation

**Interviewer:** What is exception propagation?  
**Candidate:** When an exception isn't caught in a method, it propagates up the call stack until caught or causes program termination.

---

### Throwable base class

**Interviewer:** What is the Throwable class?  
**Candidate:** It's the superclass for all exceptions and errors in Java, forming the base of Java's error-handling hierarchy.
