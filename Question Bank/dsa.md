## Arrays & Strings

### Q: How do you find the second largest number in an array using only a single traversal?

**A:**  
To find the second largest element in an array in a single pass, you maintain two variables: one for the largest (`first`) and one for the second largest (`second`). As you iterate, update these variables accordingly.  

**Real-world scenario:**  
Suppose you are processing competition scores and want to find the runner-up efficiently without sorting the entire list.

**Code:**
```python
def second_largest(arr):
    first = second = float('-inf')
    for num in arr:
        if num > first:
            second = first
            first = num
        elif first > num > second:
            second = num
    return second if second != float('-inf') else None
```
**Explanation:**  
The code keeps track of the highest and second-highest values. If the array has all identical elements or only one unique element, it returns `None`.

**Follow-up Q:**  
What if the array contains duplicate maximum values?  
**A:**  
The above approach will skip duplicates for the second largest. If you want the second *distinct* largest, this works; if not, you may need to adjust for your requirements.

---

### Q: How would you move all zeroes in an array to the end while preserving the order of non-zero elements?

**A:**  
Use two pointers: one iterates through the array, and the other (`last_non_zero`) tracks the position to place the next non-zero element.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Optimizing storage for sparse data, such as compressing arrays for efficient transmission or display.

**Code:**
```python
def move_zeroes(nums):
    last_non_zero = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            nums[last_non_zero], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[last_non_zero]
            last_non_zero += 1
```
**Explanation:**  
Non-zero elements are moved forward, and zeroes fill the remaining positions.

**Follow-up Q:**  
Is this algorithm in-place, and what is its time complexity?  
**A:**  
Yes, it's in-place (O(1) extra space), and the time complexity is O(n).

---

### Q: How do you solve the Two Sum and Three Sum problems efficiently?

**A:**  
For Two Sum, use a hash map to store previously seen numbers. For Three Sum, sort the array and use pointers.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Finding pairs of financial transactions that sum to a suspicious amount (fraud detection).

**Code (Two Sum):**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target - num in seen:
            return [seen[target - num], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```
**Explanation:**  
For each number, check if the complement exists in the map. If so, return the indices.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you extend this to Three Sum?  
**A:**  
Sort the array, then for each element, use the Two Sum approach for the remaining part of the array.

---

### Q: How do you find the maximum value in every subarray of size k (Sliding Window Maximum)?

**A:**  
Use a deque to keep track of indices of potential maximums in the current window.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Analyzing rolling maximum stock prices or smoothing noisy sensor data.

**Code:**
```python
from collections import deque
def sliding_window_max(nums, k):
    dq, res = deque(), []
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        while dq and dq[0] <= i - k:
            dq.popleft()
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < n:
            dq.pop()
        dq.append(i)
        if i >= k - 1:
            res.append(nums[dq[0]])
    return res
```
**Explanation:**  
The deque stores indices; the front is always the index of the current window's maximum.

**Follow-up Q:**  
What is the time complexity?  
**A:**  
O(n), since each element is added and removed at most once.

---

### Q: How do you find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters?

**A:**  
Use a sliding window with a set to track unique characters.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Validating password strength or compressing data by identifying unique substrings.

**Code:**
```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    chars = set()
    left = res = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in chars:
            chars.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        chars.add(s[right])
        res = max(res, right - left + 1)
    return res
```
**Explanation:**  
The window expands as long as characters are unique, and shrinks otherwise.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you modify this to return the substring itself?  
**A:**  
Track the start index and update it when a longer substring is found.

---

### Q: How can you check if a string is a valid palindrome, possibly ignoring non-alphanumeric characters?

**A:**  
Normalize the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and comparing it to its reverse.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Checking DNA sequences or validating user input in natural language processing.

**Code:**
```python
import re
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9]', '', s).lower()
    return s == s[::-1]
```
**Explanation:**  
Regular expressions strip unwanted characters; comparison is case-insensitive.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you check for palindrome with at most one character removal?  
**A:**  
Use two pointers and allow one mismatch, recursively checking the substrings.

---

### Q: How do you compress a string using run-length encoding?

**A:**  
Count consecutive repeating characters and append the count after the character.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Data compression algorithms, such as for image or text files.

**Code:**
```python
def compress(s):
    res, count = [], 1
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i-1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            res.append(s[i-1] + (str(count) if count > 1 else ''))
            count = 1
    res.append(s[-1] + (str(count) if count > 1 else ''))
    return ''.join(res)
```
**Explanation:**  
Iterate through the string, grouping consecutive identical characters.

**Follow-up Q:**  
What is the time complexity?  
**A:**  
O(n), where n is the length of the string.
---
## Searching & Sorting

### Q: How does binary search work and what are its variations?

**A:**  
Binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle, it narrows the interval to the lower half, otherwise to the upper half.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Database indexing, searching sorted logs, or any sorted dataset.

**Code:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```
**Explanation:**  
Efficient for sorted arrays, with O(log n) time complexity.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you use binary search to find the first or last occurrence of a target?  
**A:**  
Modify the search to continue if the target is found, moving left/right to find boundaries.

---
## Linked Lists

### Q: How do you reverse a singly linked list in-place?

**A:**  
Iterate through the list, reversing the direction of each node's pointer.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Undo operations in text editors, reversing user history, or implementing stack-like behavior.

**Code:**
```python
def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None
    curr = head
    while curr:
        next_node = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node
    return prev
```
**Explanation:**  
At each step, the current node's `next` pointer is redirected to the previous node.

**Follow-up Q:**  
What is the space complexity?  
**A:**  
O(1), as it reverses the list in-place.
## Trees & Graphs

### Q: What are the main tree traversal methods and when would you use each?

**A:**  
The main traversals are:
 - In-order: Left, Root, Right (for BSTs, yields sorted order)
 - Pre-order: Root, Left, Right (used for copying trees)
 - Post-order: Left, Right, Root (used for deleting trees)

**Real-world scenario:**  
Evaluating arithmetic expressions (expression trees), serializing trees for storage.

**Code (In-order):**
```python
def inorder(root):
    return inorder(root.left) + [root.val] + inorder(root.right) if root else []
```
**Explanation:**  
Recursively visits the left subtree, the root, then the right subtree.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you implement iterative tree traversals?  
**A:**  
Use a stack to simulate recursion.
## Dynamic Programming

### Q: How can you compute the nth Fibonacci number efficiently?

**A:**  
Use dynamic programming to store previously computed results and avoid redundant calculations.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Population modeling, recursive financial projections, or any scenario with overlapping subproblems.

**Code:**
```python
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
**Explanation:**  
This approach uses two variables and iterates n times, achieving O(n) time and O(1) space.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you use memoization for recursive Fibonacci?  
**A:**  
Store results in a dictionary or array to avoid recomputation.
## Stack & Queue

### Q: How do you check if a string has valid parentheses?

**A:**  
Use a stack to ensure every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Expression parsing in compilers, validating mathematical expressions, or code formatting tools.

**Code:**
```python
def is_valid(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {')':'(', '}':'{', ']':'['}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping:
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return not stack
```
**Explanation:**  
Push opening brackets onto the stack, and for each closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you extend this to support custom bracket types?  
**A:**  
Update the `mapping` dictionary with new bracket pairs.
## Heap & Priority Queue

### Q: How do you find the kth largest element in an array using a heap?

**A:**  
Use a min-heap of size k, maintaining the k largest elements seen so far.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Finding the k highest scores in a leaderboard or streaming analytics.

**Code:**
```python
import heapq
def kth_largest(nums, k):
    return heapq.nlargest(k, nums)[-1]
```
**Explanation:**  
`heapq.nlargest` efficiently finds the k largest elements; the last is the kth largest.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you solve this if the data stream is too large to store?  
**A:**  
Maintain a min-heap of size k as you process the stream.
## Hash Tables

### Q: How would you implement a basic HashMap from scratch?

**A:**  
Use an array of buckets (lists), mapping keys to bucket indices via a hash function. Use separate chaining to handle collisions.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Implementing a cache, database indexing, or symbol tables in interpreters.

**Code:**
```python
class HashMap:
    def __init__(self, size=1000):
        self.size = size
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(size)]
    def put(self, key, value):
        h = hash(key) % self.size
        for i, (k, v) in enumerate(self.table[h]):
            if k == key:
                self.table[h][i] = (key, value)
                return
        self.table[h].append((key, value))
    def get(self, key):
        h = hash(key) % self.size
        for k, v in self.table[h]:
            if k == key:
                return v
        return None
    def remove(self, key):
        h = hash(key) % self.size
        self.table[h] = [(k, v) for k, v in self.table[h] if k != key]
```
**Explanation:**  
Each bucket stores key-value pairs; collisions are resolved by storing multiple pairs in a bucket.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you handle hash collisions more efficiently?  
**A:**  
Use open addressing or more advanced hash functions.
## Bit Manipulation

### Q: How do you find the element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice?

**A:**  
Use XOR: all duplicate numbers cancel out, leaving the unique number.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Error detection in data streams or finding a corrupted entry.

**Code:**
```python
def single_number(nums):
    res = 0
    for n in nums:
        res ^= n
    return res
```
**Explanation:**  
XOR of a number with itself is 0; XOR with 0 is the number itself.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you find a number appearing once when every other appears three times?  
**A:**  
Use bit counting for each bit position.
## Advanced Topics

### Q: What is a Trie and how is it used?

**A:**  
A Trie (prefix tree) is used for efficient retrieval of strings, such as words in a dictionary. Each node represents a character, and paths from the root to leaves represent words.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Autocomplete in search engines, spell checking, and IP routing.

**Code:**
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end = False
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[c]
        node.is_end = True
    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[c]
        return node.is_end
```
**Explanation:**  
Insertion and search are both O(L), where L is the length of the word.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How would you implement prefix search?  
**A:**  
Traverse the Trie up to the prefix, then collect all words below that node.
## System Design Concepts

### Q: How do you analyze an algorithm's time and space complexity?

**A:**  
Time complexity describes how the runtime grows as input size increases; space complexity describes memory usage growth.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Planning for scalability in production systems.

**Follow-up Q:**  
What is the difference between Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega notations?  
**A:**  
Big O: Upper bound; Big Omega: Lower bound; Big Theta: Tight bound (both upper and lower).
## Problem-Solving Patterns

### Q: What is the two pointers technique and when is it useful?

**A:**  
Use two pointers to traverse a data structure from different directions or at different speeds.

**Real-world scenario:**  
Checking if an array is a palindrome, merging sorted arrays, or removing duplicates.

**Code Example:**
```python
def is_palindrome(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```
**Explanation:**  
Left and right pointers move toward each other, comparing elements.

**Follow-up Q:**  
How can two pointers be used in partitioning problems?  
**A:**  
One pointer can track the boundary between partitions.

### Deep Copy of Linked List with Random Pointer
**Explanation:**  
Create a deep copy of a linked list where each node has a random pointer.

**Use Case:**
