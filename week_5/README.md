### üîê DevSecOps and Security Best Practices

**Overview:**  
DevSecOps integrates security practices within the DevOps process, ensuring security is a shared responsibility throughout the development lifecycle. This approach helps detect vulnerabilities early and automate security checks.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Shift-left security: Incorporate security early in development.  
- Automated security testing: Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).  
- Secrets management: Use vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  
- Container security: Image scanning, runtime protection.  
- Compliance as code: Automate compliance checks (e.g., CIS benchmarks).

**Real-World Use Case:**  
Automate scanning of container images in CI/CD pipelines using tools like Trivy or Clair to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.

**Practical Code Snippet (GitHub Actions for SAST):**
```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  sast:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run SAST with Semgrep
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          config: 'p/ci'
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Development Integration (React, Angular, Vue)

**Overview:**  
Modern full-stack development requires seamless integration between backend services and frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. Understanding how to connect REST or GraphQL APIs with these frameworks is essential.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Component-based architecture  
- State management (Redux, Vuex, NgRx)  
- API consumption using fetch/axios or Apollo Client  
- Routing and navigation  
- Build tools and bundlers (Webpack, Vite)

**Real-World Use Case:**  
Building a React dashboard that consumes a Spring Boot REST API, displaying real-time data with efficient state management.

**Practical Code Snippet (React fetch example):**
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setUsers(data))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default UserList;
```

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Pulumi)

**Overview:**  
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) allows managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, enabling reproducible, version-controlled environments.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Declarative vs imperative IaC  
- Terraform: HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)  
- Pulumi: General-purpose languages (TypeScript, Python, Go)  
- State management and drift detection  
- Modular infrastructure and reusability

**Real-World Use Case:**  
Provisioning an AWS VPC with subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances using Terraform to automate environment setup.

**Practical Code Snippet (Terraform example):**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```

### üìä Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)

**Overview:**  
Observability refers to the ability to monitor and understand system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Metrics collection with Prometheus  
- Visualization with Grafana dashboards  
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)  
- Alerting and anomaly detection

**Real-World Use Case:**  
Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from a Spring Boot actuator endpoint and visualize them in Grafana for performance monitoring.

**Practical Code Snippet (Prometheus scrape config):**
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-native Concepts (AWS, Azure, GCP)

**Overview:**  
Cloud-native development leverages cloud platforms‚Äô managed services, scalability, and resilience.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Serverless computing (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions)  
- Managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)  
- Cloud storage services (S3, Blob Storage, Cloud Storage)  
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
- Cost optimization and autoscaling

**Real-World Use Case:**  
Deploying a containerized application on AWS EKS with autoscaling and integrated CloudWatch monitoring.

**Practical Code Snippet (AWS CLI to deploy Lambda):**
```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name MyFunction \
  --runtime python3.8 \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/execution_role \
  --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Integration

**Overview:**  
Integrating machine learning models into applications enhances capabilities like predictions, recommendations, and natural language understanding.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Model training vs inference  
- Serving models via REST APIs (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe)  
- Using pre-trained models and transfer learning  
- Batch vs real-time inference  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

**Real-World Use Case:**  
Deploy a sentiment analysis model as a REST API and consume it in a customer feedback application.

**Practical Code Snippet (Flask API serving a model):**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)
model = joblib.load('sentiment_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    prediction = model.predict([data['text']])
    return jsonify({'sentiment': prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
